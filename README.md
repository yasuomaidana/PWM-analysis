# PWM Analysis
In this project you will find some programs I developed to practice and understand PWM techniques.
This project will be mainly focused into understand Space Vector PWM.

I hope you enjoy this project. Feel free to leave any questions and suggestions.

## NOTES
I created some libraries, so in order to run some code you should install them first. To do it, just go to the desired
package and run
`python setup.py bdist_wheel`
then `pip install /path/to/wheelfile.whl`

Or just run
`python setup_[library].py install`
